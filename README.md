Java developer by day, racecar aerodynamics nerd by night.

I have BSc degrees in Computer Science and Aerospace Engineering and I'm currently doing a MSc in Mechanical Engineering (all at Warsaw University of Technology). I'm interested in automotive aerodynamics, and I'm trying to bring some CS knowledge into projects focusing on it:
- [AE thesis](https://github.com/rafalszulejko/hypercar-thesis) is a design and aerodynamic analysis of a self-designed supercar
- [CS thesis](https://github.com/rafalszulejko/wing-optimization) is an automated pipeline which uses ML and genetic algorithm to design a two-element racecar wing
- [current project](https://github.com/rafalszulejko/pyfluent-workflow) is set of workflows to automate Ansys Fluent CFD software
